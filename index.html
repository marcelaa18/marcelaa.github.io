		<p>Colombian architect interested in finding new ways in which architecture and urban design can generate social change, transform complex human settlements or maybe even an entire country. At DUSP, she wants to explore the role of urban planning in peace-building processes in developing countries like her own.<br><br>Her work experience ranges from architectural design at Felipe Uribe's studio and urban planning for the oil-company Pacific to public policy and strategy consultancy at an innovation lab.</p>

		<div id="details"> <!-- Description of Exercise Here -->
			<p><i>Why:</i> Analyze and understand the urban processes involved in the construction of the temporary tent-city that accommodates approximately 3 million visitors simultaneously (aprox. 100 million pass during the entire duration of the festival) during the world’s largest religious festival, the Hindu Kumbh Mela- which occurs every twelve years on the confluence of the rivers Ganges and Yamuna.<br><br>  
			<i>When:</i> Estimated time period, June 2012 to November 2014<br><br>
			<i>How:</i> The documentation of spaces was carried out in a variety of media including plan and section drawings, diagrams, aerial and satellite photography and film. The maps were constructed in GIS based on a systematic series of aerial photographs as well as people counting estimations trough satellite photography and head-counters from a series of watch-towers. Mapping is also used to calculate the road capacities and understand people flows during the major bathing days. <br><br>
			<i>What:</i> The team aimed to map the 23.5-square-kilometer area of the festival with a double focus on the physical and the ephemeral qualities of the festival. The physical structure of the settlement, included the hierarchy of residential sectors, the attribution of spaces for public amenities, the location and organization of infrastructures (tents, roads, police and crowd control, sanitation, etc) and the proximity of these spaces to the river; and the ephemeral events included the routes that the pilgrims take between different parts of the city, the parade routes of the Akharas for the major moments of bathing, and the nighttime celebrations.<br><br>
			The research explores how the ephemeral and the physical aspects of the city function together during the 55 days of the festival and concludes with reflections on how the systems that emerge in its development can be applied to sustainable urban design in other nations and contexts, ranging from other massive temporary festivals like Burning Man to the refugee's camps in Syria.
